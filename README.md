# NAS-Chocolate-Business-Sales-Analysis-Using-Tableau
NAS Chocolate, a producer of milk and dark chocolate, engaged us to develop a comprehensive sales report across its operating countries. My team analyzed sales by country, identified the top 10 salespersons overall and per country, and delivered a Tableau dashboard summarizing total sales, boxes shipped, and shipment counts.

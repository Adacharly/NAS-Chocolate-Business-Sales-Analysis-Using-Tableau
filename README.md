# Business Introduction

NAS Chocolate is a multinational confectionery company specializing in premium milk and dark chocolate products distributed across multiple international markets. As global operations expanded, leadership required clear visibility into sales performance across countries and sales teams to support strategic growth, resource allocation, and performance management.

To address this need, NAS Chocolate commissioned the development of a comprehensive sales performance dashboard to consolidate key business metrics and provide actionable insights across its regions of operation.

# Problem Statement

Prior to this analysis, NAS Chocolate faced several reporting and decision-making challenges:

- Limited visibility into total global sales performance
- Lack of standardized reporting across operating countries
- Difficulty identifying top-performing sales personnel
- No centralized summary of shipments and distribution volume
- Inability to compare country-level contributions to overall revenue

Without an integrated view of these metrics, leadership could not effectively evaluate market performance or optimize sales strategy.
